    <h1>Face Drawing Classification</h1>
    <p class="author">Maxwell Yu</p>
    <p>For my science research project, I choose to learn more about deep learning and neural networks. As my final product, I've created this interactive demo which can tell the difference between smiley and frowny faces! Thank you to everyone who drew faces to help train the algorithm!</p>
    <p>Just draw a face in the space below, and click the button to try it out!</p>

    <div class="page visible" id="inputPage">
      <canvas id="canvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
      <div id="controls">
        <button onclick="predict()">guess!</button>
        <button onclick="saveImage('face')">save image</button>
        <button onclick="clearImage()">discard image</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="page" id="resultPage">
      <p>You drew a...</p>
      <div id="result">???</div>

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <p>When you click &quot;guess&quot;, the data is fed into
        what is called a convolutional neural network.</p>
    <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>A neural network is a special type of algorithm which
        mimics the structure of the human brain. They are used for deep learning, a type of machine learning.
        Machine learning simply refers to algorithms that &quot;learn&quot; as they are exposed to more data,
        and is a form of AI. Machine learning is used in many fields for many purposes, for example, to detect
        COVID-19 from a recording of a cough!</p>
    <p>Neural networks are made up of many artificial
        neurons, each of which have inputs and an output. These inputs are &quot;weighted&quot;, which means
        that they are multiplied with number. This controls how much each input affects the neuron. By tweaking
        these weights, the network can &quot;learn&quot;. This is much like how pathways in our brain become
        more sensitive the more they are used. At the center of a neuron is the summation function, which
        combines the inputs using complicated math to create the output.
        The output may also go through an activation function, a sort of threshold.</p>

    <p>These neurons are organized in &quot;layers&quot;.
        Each layer consists of some number of neurons, whose outputs are the inputs of the next layer. There are
        different types of layers which are suitable for different purposes. These layers are then arranged to
        form an neural network/model.</p>

    <h3>Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>For my project, I created/trained a convolutional
        neural network. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specific type of neural network that uses
        convolution layers. These layers excel at image processing, and are used for reducing the data to a
        simpler form while recognizing and extracting key features. Essentially, a &quot;kernel&quot; scans
        through the image, and uses a summation formula to combine adjacent pixels. Each group of pixels it
        combines becomes one pixel in the output. It does this in 2D space, as opposed to as a 1D list.</p>
    <p>In between the convolutional layers, there are
        &quot;pooling layers&quot;, which also simplify the data but in a more direct way. At the end of the
        model, there are also usually a few normal layers to convert the data into a good output form.</p>

    <h3>Training and creating the model</h3>
    <p>To create my neural network, I started by collecting
        data. Thank you to everyone who volunteered to draw faces! From what I&#x27;ve learned, it usually takes
        a lot of data (tens of thousands!) to train a neural network. However, I was only able to collect 140
        images in total. As such, I was very surprised at how well it turned out!</p>

        Google Colab notebook</a> I used to create, train, and export the model.</p>
